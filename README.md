## Introduction


Academic performance/graduation in a population is an important factor in their overall employability which contributes towards economic development. This Data Science project predicts the Student Dropout given the factors on demography, socioeconomics, macroeconomics and relevant academic data provided by the Student on enrollment. This prediction is important to understand the student academic capacity. This important knowledge can be used to identify key areas of development such as, development of socially disadvantaged communities, improvement of academic programs, development of educational funding programs  etc.  


The dataset used in the project contains data collected at the time of student enrollment. This include discrete and continuous data that capture the various facets of the student. These include macroeconomic factors of inflation, GDP and unemployment rate. It covers the personal/family details of the student such as gender, previous grade, educational special needs, financial status, parents education, parents occupation. It captures aspects of the educational system such as courswork enrolled, day/evening classes, scholarships offered etc. The dataset is created by Valentim Realinho, Mónica Vieira Martins, Jorge Machado, and Luís Baptista from the Politechnic Institue of Portalegre. It was sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and can be downloaded from <b> here </b>. Each row represent the detaining pertaining to an individual student and there are no duplicates.
