### Introduction

This code of conduct controls the group 6 team's environment. 
We anticipate that we will be able to explain our principles and commitments to one another on a high level, as well as respect one another on the team. We made this repository public in order to contribute our values to this ongoing discussion in the field of education and to inspire more people to pay attention to it and learn more on their own. As a team, we will continue to revise and evolve this repository as time goes on.

### Scope
This code of conduct applies to multiple locations, both within the project space and in public, where we represent the group 6 team and our dropout-prediction project. Communicating via the official team/project email, sharing thoughts via the official account on various social media platforms, having the best and most suitable manners both online and offline, and so on are examples of how they are represented.

### Values
We want this project to be a harmonious, enjoyable, successful, and welcoming environment for every team member. We value the opinions of every team member. Additionally, there are a number of other things that set our project team apart.
At MDS, we collaborate with and support other teams. At MDS, we are surrounded by other professionals who can provide us with helpful perspectives. We encourage positive working relationships and keep the channels of communication open.
Every skill, whether "soft" or "hard," is valued by us. We place the same weight on soft skills as we do on the technical coding work completed by team members. This is due to the fact that a group project's success depends not just on the coding component, but also on communication, insight, and the way we value each other's contributions. 
We are open to variety. Of fact, this is one of our guiding principles. By embracing diversity and inclusion, we can combat institutional discrimination.


### Expected behaviors
It is expected that every team member will work just as hard as the others, keep in mind our teammates, and support one another. We should make every effort to foster a cooperative, secure, uplifting, and supportive environment where we may all succeed.
Be helpful when a teammate asks for assistance.
Be cooperative as you attempt to consider the questions.
When receiving and providing feedback, act with kindness and respect.
Unacceptable behaviors
The team is committed to being considerate of people of different races, gender identities, gender expressions, sexual orientations, physical abilities, nations, ages, etc. in order to create a productive and positive work environment. Any harsh or discriminatory language is not acceptable in team communications.



### Committing to improvement
We are all aware of our flaws due to our varied upbringings. We are urged to keep a record of our errors and reflect on them so that we can work to correct them in the future, strengthening and improving our team.
