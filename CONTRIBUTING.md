## How Can I Contribute?

### 1. Fixing typos

If you spot any minor typos or grammatical errors in the documentation, you can modify it right away using the GitHub web interface as long as you make the changes in the project's _source_ file.

### 2. Reporting Bugs

  Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've determined [which repository](#atom-and-packages) your bug is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information by filling in [the template](https://github.com/atom/.github/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md).

#### How Do I Submit A Bug Report?

  The process described here has several goals:
- Maintain dropout-prediction's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Enable a sustainable system for dropout-prediction's maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:
1. Follow all instructions in the templates: 
    - [Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)
    - [R](https://style.tidyverse.org)
2. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing 

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.
